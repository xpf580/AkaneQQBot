#### AkaneQQBot ####

**A complete replacement for GPTbot, where the robot and environment are entirely separated**

## Usage ##

**Optional**: You can choose not to download `./AkaneENV` and install the required dependencies in your own virtual environment by executing the following command in the terminal: `pip install -r re.txt`

Navigate to the `.\chat\myapp` directory and enter your OpenAI API key in the `openai_key.py` file.

Navigate to the `.\go-cqhttp` directory and enter your QQ account information in the `config.yml` file. No need to input the password.

**In the terminal, input `.\Akane_quick_start.bat` or run the script directly to open three PowerShell terminals at once.**
